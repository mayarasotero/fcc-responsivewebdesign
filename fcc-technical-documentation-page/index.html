                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need
                to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a
                certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and
                colors?

                Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet
                language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
                paragraph text, setting the color to red:
            </p>
            <code>
                p {
                    color: red;
                  }
            </code>
            <p>
                Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the
                file as style.css in a directory named styles.
            </p>

                <h2>Anatomy of CSS</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:
            </p>
            <img
                src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png">
            <p>
                The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.)
            </p>
            <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
                </li>
                <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:
            </p>
            <code>
                p {
                color: red;
                width: 500px;
                border: 1px solid black;
                }
                </code>
        </section>
        <section id="Fonts_and_Text" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Fonts and Text</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Now that we've explored some CSS fundamentals, let's improve the appearance of the example by adding
                more
                rules and information to the style.css file.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>First, find the output from Google Fonts that you previously saved from What will your website look
                    like?. Add the
                    <link> element somewhere inside your index.html's head (anywhere between the

                    <code>< head></code> and <code>< /head></code> tags). It looks something like this:<br><br>
                    <code>< link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet"></code>
                    <p>This code links your page to a style sheet that loads the Open Sans font family with your
                        webpage.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Next, delete the existing rule you have in your style.css file. It was a good test, but let's not
                        continue with lots of red text.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Add the following lines (shown below), replacing the font-family assignment with your font-family
                        selection from What will your website look like?. The property font-family refers to the font(s)
                        you
                        want to use for text. This rule defines a global base font and font size for the whole page.
                        Since
                        < html> is the parent element of the whole page, all elements inside it inherit the same
                            font-size
                            and font-family.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id="CSS_all_about_boxes" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>CSS all about boxes</h2>
            </header>
            <p>
                Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes. This includes setting size, color,
                and position. Most HTML elements on your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.</li>
                    <li>border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.</li>
                    <li>margin, the space around the outside of the border.</li>
                </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Reference" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>Reference</h2></header>
            <p>
